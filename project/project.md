## Abstract

This project will be looking at the change of internet capabilities throughout the world. We will be looking into each
countries progression of internet and mobile phone usage. Analyzing the differences between continents and countries. We will also be looking at each countryâ€™s economic ranking and seeing the
differences between economic levels. This project will be looking at how the world has progressed into the digital world.

## Data

Data for this project will be supplied from data.worldbanks. The first dataset will be containing the percentage of individuals using the internet per country.
Here is the [datast](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true&view=map). The second dataset contains all countries and the number of subscriptions to mobile phone plan.
The data set can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.CEL.SETS.P2?most_recent_value_desc=true). Both of these datasets cover over multiple years.

### Data Usage

We will be using python to analyze the data and build visualizations. We want to see how the progression of the modern ages progressed over countries and see how rapid it was.

## Data Cleaning

The data is formatted in a way in which it is hard to read and visualize. We will build our own data frame from each country and their progression over the years. 

## Analyst

Using the cleansed data we can now start analyzing it and visualizing it. We will start the analyst by looking at the progession of change between each year and how it grows. Making sure to highlight large jumps from years or over 5 years.
We will then start charting out the change within visualizations. 

## Visualization

With visualization we can visualize the percentage growth and change of each country on a map. Using a gradient scale it will show which country has the highest growth compared to the others. It will also help visualize the general areas of where growth is pertaking.
Visualization will also happen for analyzing including looking at what countries have the highest overal rate of change within a time frame. Making an interactive map will also be an interesting project in which users can change the years to see how it changes.

## Future
Making these visulizations update autonomously.
Projecting the future growth and seeing what it might look like in 5 years.

## Plans

## coding
Need to understand the data more and start analyzing it. This will be the hardest area as I am experienced with coding but need to get back into it.
Will need to make visulizations for the project.
Need to make it so it can read all the data easily and without changing variables
Need to understand the statistics

## report
Clean up the report and add images from visulizations. 
writing in markdown has its issues but is easily to learn after going through it after awhile.
Need to make the report an actual report with the langauge of a report

## TA Plans
Already met with TA once will meet with them again for help on coding and report langauge.
