# Abstract: 

In 2050 the United Nations is projecting that 90% of the world will have access to the internet. With the recent pandemic and the shift from most things being online we see how desperate people need internet to be able to do everyday tasks. The internet is a valuable utility and more people are getting access to it every day. We also are seeing more and more data is being sent over the internet with more than 24,000 Gigabytes being uploaded and processed per second across the entire internet. In this report we look at the progression of the internet and how it has changed over the years. 

# Team
This project is a solo project done by Matthew Cummings

## Background:
In 1965 Thomas Merrill and Lawrence G. Roberts started the first ever wide-area computer network ever built. The internet first started out as huge machines that where sizes of small houses that were only capable of transferring small amounts of data, or packets as they soon invented. The internet at the time was not even called internet but ARPANET, Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. This Network backed by the US Department Of Defense used node-to-node communication to send a message of “LOGIN”. It crashed after “LO” was sent. Following more research and development the TCP/IP, transmission control protocol and internet protocol, was developed and adopted into the APARTNET in 1983. TCP/IP is how packets are sent all over the internet. This system uses the packet-switched network where information is broken into packets and sent to different routers, IP, where it is then put back together on the receiving end and resembled into what it was originally, TCP (brit). When the internet was developed there was many different communities and the growth of these communities brought problems. There was no one group or organization that organized these groups and all these communities were on different platforms and areas. This is when IAB, internet activities board, and Tim Berners-Lee from MIT came together to develop the World Wide Web and its primary community of World Wide Web Consortium, W3C. W3C is now the primary group who make protocols and standards for the WWW. This group is still actively watching and helping the WWW to make sure it is growing steadily and supported through the internet. 

#Data
Data for this project will be supplied from data.worldbanks. The first dataset will be containing the percentage of individuals using the internet per country.
Here is the [datast](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true&view=map). The second dataset contains all countries and the number of subscriptions to mobile phone plan.
The data set can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.CEL.SETS.P2?most_recent_value_desc=true). Both of these datasets cover over multiple years.

## Data Within Internet:

The internet has progressed largely from not being able to send a simple message like “LOGIN” from one computer to another. We are now seeing 24,000 gigabytes per second being passed and uploaded throughout the internet. To give perspective on this 1 gigabyte can hold up to 341 average sized digital pictures, or one megabyte is equal to 873 plain text pages and there are 1000 megabytes in 1 gigabyte. That is 873,000 pages of plain text per gigabyte and the internet is sending and uploading about 24,000 gigabytes per second, that is 24,952,000,000 pages of plain text pages being sent over the internet. This large quantity of data and information is passed throughout the internet every second and usually without any hiccups or data issues. This data and information has not always been here. Most of it is relatively new with 90% of most data on the internet being created post 2016. This data is still growing and will continue to grow. With more than 4.4 billion people on the internet all these users are pumping more data and this data is being passed around to each of these other users. With 7.5 billion people on earth almost 60% of people on earth are using the internet and are contributing to the amount of data on it. This change hasn’t been a slow change but an explosion of change and new users. In 2014 there was only 2.4 billion users on the internet. Within 5 years we see a growth of 2 billions users and with that we see and ever increasing amount of data being sent and uploaded. Some of this data is being stored and used throughout the world every day and we have companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft who store this data. Between them it is estimated that they store 1.2 million terabytes of internet data. Just looking at these 4 companies we see the magnitude of the data that is being stored and kept throughout the internet and each day these numbers grow. To give some perspective on how large that data storage is 1 Terabyte is 1000 gigabytes of data. Cisco even estimates that there has been over 1 zettabyte of data created and uploaded on the internet in 2016, zettabyte is 1000 exabytes an exabyte is 1000 petabytes and a petabyte is 1000 terabytes. That is a lot of data and information being sent and passed throughout the internet. It is also estimated that in 2018 we have reached 18 zettabytes. We see the growth of this data being passed through out the internet in 2 years from being 1 zettabyte to being 18. This growth wont stop or slow down but continue to expand and grow as it is being predicted to be about 175 zettabytes within the year 2025. That is enough information to store on DVDs that can circle the earth 222 times (benard). Now this data is not all being stored but just uploaded or sent to other users. With an overwhelmingly number of this data coming from the social media companies and posts people are sending to each other. We are also seeing the growth within searches with Google getting over 3.5 Billion searches every day. We will see how this data came to be and how the internet slowly took over the world.

## Data Analysis of Internet Change:

##Visualization
With visualization we can visualize the percentage growth and change of each country on a map. Using a gradient scale it will show which country has the highest growth compared to the others. It will also help visualize the general areas of where growth is pertaking.
Visualization will also happen for analyzing including looking at what countries have the highest overal rate of change within a time frame. Making an interactive map will also be an interesting project in which users can change the years to see how it changes.

#Future
Making these visulizations update autonomously.
Projecting the future growth and seeing what it might look like in 5 years.

#Plans

##coding
Need to understand the data more and start analyzing it. This will be the hardest area as I am experienced with coding but need to get back into it.
Will need to make visulizations for the project.
Need to make it so it can read all the data easily and without changing variables
Need to understand the statistics

##report
Clean up the report and add images from visulizations. 
writing in markdown has its issues but is easily to learn after going through it after awhile.
Need to make the report an actual report with the langauge of a report

#TA Plans
Already met with TA once will meet with them again for help on coding and report langauge.
